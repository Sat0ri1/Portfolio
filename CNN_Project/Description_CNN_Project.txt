This project's goal is to create and teach the convolutional neural network to recognize animals species
First goal is my Master's degree thesis: "Use of convolutional neural networks in recognizing Theraphosidae species."

First version will be teached to recognize mainly females of as many Tarantula species as can be recognized by a picture of a top side of a spider

Pictures choices are based on quality and position of the spider on a picture. In general there should be whole spider visible in every picture and picture should be taken from the top (not literally, because some curves will let me create a model more friendly in use, not requiring a perfect picture to work. I try to get at least 100 pics per species. Amount is not huge, therefore I implemented a little bit more aggresive augmentation. 

Datasets used for training and testing won't be available here, due to copyright, as they will contain many pictures that I am only allowed to use due to creative commons. 

Training will take place with use of CUDA, due to boosted efficiency in AI training with GPU.

For now I trained the model for two tarantula species: Poecilotheria metallica and Chilobrachys natanicharum. It looks really promising (model is not overfitted but it's accuracy is approximately 100% and it succesfully recognized 100% of pictures I tested it on after the formal training and testing phase). Therefore, I continue to collect the pictures of other species, aiming for at least 100 of them (final number will depend on amout of pictures available).
